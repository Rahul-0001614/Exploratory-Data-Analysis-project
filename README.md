# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-project

introduction:-

          In Python, EDA  is a crucial step in the data analysis process that involves studying, exploring, and visualizing information to derive important insights.EDA is the main step in the process of various data analysis. It helps data to visualize the patterns, characteristics, and relationships between variables. python provides various libraries for EDA such as numpy, pandas,matplotlib, and seaborn.

Exploratory data analysis methods:-

      1.  Reading dataset 
      2.  analyzing the data
      3.  check for the duplicates
      4.  missing values calculation
      5.  Exploratory data analysis:-
                  -  Univariate analysis
                  -  bivariate analysis
                  -  multivariate analysis

what is work done on our project?

      1. for example load dataset in vs code is real estate pricing
      2. drop duplicates of data
      3. data cleaning
      4. EDA data analysis
      5. standardization method apply
      6. find insights into how to impact different amenities in sale price.
      7. Make a sales report for the year and month.


          in this EDA project, I am learning how to find insights into data sets by using data visualization techniques. this project also finds business-related problems, how to impact which variable impacts the sales price, and making sales reports.
