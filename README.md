introduction:-

In Python, EDA  is a crucial step in the data analysis process that involves studying, exploring, and visualizing information to derive important insights.EDA is the main step in the process of various data analysis. It helps data to visualize the patterns, characteristics, and relationships between variables. python provides various libraries for EDA such as numpy, pandas,matplotlib, and seaborn.

Exploratory data analysis methods:-

  1.  Reading dataset
  2.  analyzing the data
  3.  check for the duplicates
  4.  missing values calculation
  5.  Exploratory data analysis:-
                  -  Univariate analysis
                  -  bivariate analysis
                  -  multivariate analysis
